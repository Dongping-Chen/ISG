The user should input a list of any-length proportions indicating the position of the screenshot and how many screenshots to take within the total duration of the video. Therefore, you should calculate the proportion (degree/360) step by step, degree is degree when direction is right, degree is 360-degree when direction is left. For example, if the user wants (45-right, 90-right, 90-left, 45-left) views, the degrees are [45,90,270,315] so the input list should be [0.125, 0.250, 0.750, 0.875] in DECIMAL form. If there is perspectives like up/down, use 0 to displace them since the model don't have ability to generate different height's view.
